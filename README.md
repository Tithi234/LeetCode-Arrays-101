# 🧩 Array 101 — LeetCode Practice Solutions

Welcome to my **Array 101** repository!  
This repo contains my Python solutions to all problems from the **LeetCode Array 101** study plan.  
Each file represents a separate problem that helped me strengthen my understanding of arrays, loops, and in-place operations.

## 📚 Completed Problems

| # | Problem | File | Description |
|---|----------|------|--------------|
| 1 | **Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits** | [`even_numbers.py`](even_numbers.py) | Counts how many numbers in an array contain an even number of digits. |
| 2 | **Squares of a Sorted Array** | [`square_sorted.py`](square_sorted.py) | Squares each number and returns a sorted array of the squares. |
| 3 | **Duplicate Zeros** | [`duplicate_zereos.py`](duplicate_zereos.py) | Duplicates each zero in the array in-place and shifts the remaining elements to the right. |
| 4 | **Merge Sorted Array** | [`merge_sorted.py`](merge_sorted.py) | Merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array in non-decreasing order. |
| 5 | **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array** | [`remove_duplicate.py`](remove_duplicate.py) | Removes duplicates in-place from a sorted array and returns the new length. |
| 6 | **Check If N and Its Double Exist** | [`double_n (1).py`](double_n%20(1).py) | Checks if there exists two integers N and M such that N = 2 * M. |
| 7 | **Valid Mountain Array** | [`valid_mountain.py`](valid_mountain.py) | Determines if an array forms a valid mountain sequence (strictly increasing then strictly decreasing). |
| 8 | **Sort Array by Parity** | [`array_parity.py`](array_parity.py) | Reorders an array so that all even elements come before all odd elements. |
